- User setting â€“ User must be able to edit his/her account
- Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
- The app should use AJAX at some point.
 
### Bonus points

- Use unit testing.
- All actions are done client side using AJAX, avoiding to refresh the page.
- REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via an API, including authentication.
- Explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
